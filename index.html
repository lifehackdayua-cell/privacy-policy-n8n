    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 10, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>n8n Automation</strong> (the "Application"). This Application is developed and operated by <strong>Illia Vasylchenko</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you interact with our Instagram automation services. This policy is designed to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Meta (Facebook) Platform Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide automated response services, we collect and process the following specific data points received directly from the Instagram Graph API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Instagram Scoped User ID (IGSID):</strong> A unique identifier specific to our application to manage your session.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> Your public Instagram name (username).</li>
        <li><strong>Message Content:</strong> The text and media content of the Direct Messages (DMs) you send to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Timestamps of when messages are sent and received.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We process your information for the sole purpose of providing automated customer service and interaction. Specifically, we use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read and Reply to Messages:</strong> We utilize the specific Meta permission <code>instagram_manage_messages</code> to technically enable our system to receive your messages via webhooks and send automated replies.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Requests:</strong> Analyze the text of your message to determine the appropriate response using our automation logic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Processing and Technology</h2>
    <p>We believe in transparency regarding our technology stack. Your data is processed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automation Engine (n8n):</strong> We utilize a <strong>self-hosted instance</strong> of n8n. This means your data is processed on our own controlled server infrastructure and is NOT passed to n8n’s public cloud servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Webhooks:</strong> Data is transmitted from Instagram to our self-hosted n8n instance via secure, encrypted webhooks (HTTPS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>To generate intelligent responses, we may share message text with AI processors (Anthropic/OpenAI). These providers are strictly authorized to use your data only as necessary to provide these services.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only as long as necessary. You have the right to request the deletion of your data.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Request Data Deletion:</strong> Send an email to <strong>lifehackday.ua@gmail.com</strong> with the subject line "Data Deletion Request". Please include your Instagram Username. We will process requests within 30 days.</p>
